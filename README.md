## What is _git-plumber_?

[git-plumber](https://github.com/ejiektpobehuk/git-plumber) is a CLI and TUI application for **exploring the internals of git repositories** in a safe, read-only way.
Browse and understand the contents of the `.git/` directory: refs, trees, blobs and more.
Demystifying compressed and binary ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù beneath git‚Äôs familiar porcelain appearance.

Perfect for learning, live experimentation, or just satisfying your curiosity.

### Use cases


- **Learning with _[‚ÄúPro Git‚Äù 10. Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain))_**: Fire up `git-plumber` in a test repository and see immediately how every command reshapes your repo‚Äôs internals.
- **Understanding git storage**: See for yourself how git stores differences between versions ‚Äî the reason this app was created!

### What _git-plumber_ is not?

- **Not** a replacement for everyday git workflow
- **Not** a ‚Äúporcelain‚Äù UI like [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) or [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- **Not** an interface for running plumbing commands, but a worthy alternative to `git cat-file` or `git verify-pack`

## Roadmap & Contributions

This app is my git learning project.
It's going to be more complete as my knowledge grows.

For planned features checkout [issues at GitHub](https://github.com/ejiektpobehuk/git-plumber/issues).

**Major goals**:

- Navigation hints
- Support for all native git files
- Clear "unsupported" indicators
- Internationalization (i18n)
- [git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug) support
- [jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) support

**PRs/issues welcome ‚Äî no need to be a git guru!**
Beginners and documentation helpers are especially appreciated.
If something is unclear, that‚Äôs a sign the app can get better: lease [open an issue](https://github.com/ejiektpobehuk/git-plumber/issues/new) or start a discussion!

**Not a git management tool.
Not for your day-to-day workflow.
This is for those who want to see git‚Äôs wiring and learn how it all fits together.**
